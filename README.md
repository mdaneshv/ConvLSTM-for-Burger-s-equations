# Introduction

This repository contains data science projects on deep learning and machine learning. Codes are written in `Python`.   

- ## First Topic (Data Driven Prediction of Dynamical Systems)

I have exploited ConvLSTM neural networks to predict solution of Inviscid Burgers equation.


- ## Second Topic (Convolutional Neural Networks with TensorFlow)

This is a tutorial project to show how to use TensorFlow to load data and build simple models to predict the data

- ## Third Topic (Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: EfficientNet)

This is a project on Kaggle for detecting Cassava Leaf disease. I have implemented Efficientnet with TensorFlow which is a prtrained Deep-CNN.
