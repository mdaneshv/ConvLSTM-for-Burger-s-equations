# Introduction

This repository contains data science projects on deep learning and machine learning. Codes are written in `Python`.  


- ## :green_book: First Topic (Data Driven Prediction of Dynamical Systems)

I have exploited ConvLSTM neural networks to predict solution of Inviscid Burgers equation. Click the link below for more details.


-  ## :orange_book: Second Topic (Convolutional Neural Networks with TensorFlow)

This is a tutorial project to show how to use TensorFlow to load data and build simple models for prediction. Click the link below for more details.

- ## :blue_book:  Third Topic (Deep Convolutional Neural Networks: EfficientNet)

This is a project on Kaggle for detecting Cassava Leaf disease. I have implemented a pretrained Efficientnet with TensorFlow. EfficientNet is a very deep convolutional neural network architecture which uses a scaling method to uniformly scale the dimensions. Click the link below for more details.
